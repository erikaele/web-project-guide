AWS is responsible for delivering most of our web experience to the end users, and given how much traffic our sites receive, it can get quite expensive. 

To help with cost control, there are several actions that we can take to make sure our bills stay within reasonable limits. One such method is using savings plans. 

## Savings Plans
A savings plan on AWS means that you commit to a certain amount of usage every month in exchange for a discounted price. The commitments are either 1-year or 3-year agreements with AWS and how they work depends on the product.

### Compute Plan
A compute savings plan is the most flexible, and that is the advantage of this program. It covers EC2, Lambda, and Fargate. With this plan, you have flexibility to change EC2 instance types, regions, and tenancy. If there is the possibility for unpredicted in traffic, new geographic market strategies, or the need to change instance types, this is a great option. The downside is that this type of plan doesn't receive as much of a discount in exchange for the flexibility.
